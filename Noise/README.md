# 🧪 Noise Tutorials: How bio noise interacts with ML models and how to manipulate it 

This folder contains hands-on tutorials developed as part of **TheBioMLClinic**, demonstrating the impact of noisy or imperfect data on machine learning models in the context of biology and peptide/AAV engineering.

## 📘 Current Tutorial

### Good Models, Bad Data — Classification with Noisy Peptide Labels
- **Objective:** Show how machine learning models can still learn useful patterns even when training labels are heavily corrupted with noise.  
- **Focus Dataset:** `12merPeptideFitness_Classification_250K`  
- **Task:** Binary classification (fitness vs. non-fitness peptides).  
- **Key Lessons:**
  - The counterintuitive reality of learning from noisy labels in biological datasets.  
  - How to handle the models to force them to learn well from data with noisy labels.
